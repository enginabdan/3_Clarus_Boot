										Data Visualization with Tableau
	
Sales Analysis of a Website with Tableau
1. Overview
	1. Visual analysis is a non-linear process.
	2. For example, a user might start with an initial task or question in mind, find relevant data, and prepare it for analysis.
	3. During analysis, she/he realizes that she/he needs additional data,
	4. so she/he goes back a couple of steps to get more data,
	5. choose a new visual mapping, and develop new insight.
	6. This example can be repeated for any of the other steps of the cycle of visual analysis.
	7. The flow of analysis is difficult or impossible to achieve in traditional BI.
	8. Instead of exploiting the power of visual cues and iteration, it is heavily milestone-driven.
	9. Requirements gathering leads to development, then to testing, and eventually to launch.
	10. With visual analysis, the steps become more fluid as the answer to one question often leads to other questions, and new insights are uncovered.

2. Instructions
	1. In this project, you will be working on the Sales Analysis of a Website project using Tableau.  

3. Data Preparation
	1. Import sales.csv data set.
	2. You will study the whole dataset.
	3. First, go with Live connection and observe the performance.
	4. Then, switch your connection to Extract.
	5. Examine the data set.
	6. Tableau displays the first 1000 rows by default in the data grid.
	7. Get a general understanding of what the dataset is about.
	8. Understand what a row-level record represents.
	9. Change the workbook locale to the United States. (Go to your workspace and come back to Data Source Page)
	10. Identify the data types of all columns and change any if needed.
	11. Additional Data: currency_rates.csv
	12. You can use currency_rates.csv when you need.
	13. You will relate to the other dataset.
	14. Be careful with duplications.
	15. You may need to establish relationships in more than one area.	

4. Data Exploration
  In this part, you will create 17 worksheets.
  You will search for answers to the following questions.
  The number at the beginning of each item below represents the sheet number.
  You must put that number before each sheet name.
  Choose any sheet name you want.
  For instance, a sheet name for the first item below may be **1-Number of Records**
	1. Go to Sheet 1 (your workspace) and find how many records the data set has.
	2. Find the total number of sellers.
	3. What is the total value of sales in EUR?
	4. Which brand has the highest number of purchases during the period? Create a horizontal bar chart display. Observe that there are null values. Think about how to deal with the null values. Create a new field named Brand-Updated. Replace null values with **Unknown**. Change the old Brand field with Brand-Updated.
	5. How many items in the “Jewellery” category have no brand associated with them? 
	6. How many brands have between 35 and 55 transactions (inclusive)? (Suggested Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart)
