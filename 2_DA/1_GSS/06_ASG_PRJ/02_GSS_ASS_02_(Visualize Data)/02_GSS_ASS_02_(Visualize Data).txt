gss_assigment2_chart

Let's visualize popular language data. But this time in Google Sheets!

First, you have to download the zipped CSV file then open it with GSS.

Then use some functions to prepare data for getting the chart above (x-axis = language names, y-axis = their counts).

The dataset may force the limits of both your computer and Google Sheets.

If you have trouble studying, you can only use the first 10000 rows.

When you finish your study, please submit the Google Sheets file link to your answer. (Do not forget to give appropriate permissions)

Tip: A text and the FLATTEN function may help you a lot.
